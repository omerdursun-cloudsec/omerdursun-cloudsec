# Hi, I'm Ömer Dursun 👋

Aspiring Application & Cloud Security Engineer  
Cybersecurity student focused on **web application security**, **cloud security (AWS)** and **secure architectures**.

---

## 🎯 Who I Am (Right Now – Honestly)

- 🎓 **Student** actively learning cybersecurity. Not a senior engineer (yet).
- 🔐 Building a foundation in **Application Security (OWASP Top 10)** and **Cloud Security (AWS)**.
- 🧠 Goal: become a **proof-driven security engineer** who can show *clear, reproducible evidence* for every finding and mitigation.

I’m not there yet — but I’m documenting the entire journey in public.

## 📚 What I’m Currently Learning

- **Web Security Basics**
  - HTTP, sessions, cookies, authentication
  - Input validation, output encoding

- **OWASP Top 10 (2021)**
  - A01: Broken Access Control
  - A02: Cryptographic Failures
  - A03: Injection
  - A05: Security Misconfiguration  
  *(lab lab gidiyorum, atlamıyorum)*

- **Cloud & AWS (Beginner Level)**
  - IAM basics (users, roles, policies)
  - S3, EC2, basic networking concepts
  - Intro to logging: CloudTrail, GuardDuty (conceptual)

- **Tools & Platforms**
  - Burp Suite Community
  - OWASP ZAP
  - TryHackMe / HackViser-like labs
  - Git & GitHub basics

---

## 🧪 Core Repositories (Work in Progress)

I’m building a small set of **realistic** repositories instead of fake enterprise projects:

- `owasp-top10-labs` → Hands-on labs for selected OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  
- `cloud-security-notes` → My personal notes on AWS & cloud security basics.  
- `security-learning-journal` → Weekly logs of what I study and practice.

None of these are “finished” — they grow as I learn.

---

## 🛠 Tech & Tools (Realistic Level)

**Languages (Beginner / Learning):**
- Python (simple scripts & automation)
- HTML / CSS / basic JavaScript

**Security Tools:**
- Burp Suite Community (intercept, repeater)
- OWASP ZAP (scans + manual)
- Nmap (basic usage)
- Linux basics: curl, grep, etc.

**Cloud & Automation (Learning):**
- AWS (IAM, S3, EC2 concepts)
- Docker (very basic)
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 📈 Learning Roadmap

**0–6 Months (Short Term)**

- Finish OWASP Top 10 labs (with write-ups in GitHub)
- Build 2–3 very small vulnerable apps and secure them
- Document every step with **screenshots + notes**
- Keep a **public learning journal** in a dedicated repo

**6–18 Months (Mid Term)**

- Get stronger in **AppSec (code review + testing)**
- Improve **AWS security understanding**
- Learn basic automation (Python scripts for security tasks)
- Contribute to open-source security labs or docs

---

## 🌍 How I Work

- No fake titles, no drama.
- Prefer **small but real** projects over big fake portfolios.
- Care about:
  - Clear documentation
  - Reproducible steps
  - Real screenshots / PoCs
  - Continuous improvement

> “Security is not just protection — it’s **proof**. I’m currently building the skills to produce that proof.”
